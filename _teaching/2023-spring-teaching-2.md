Applications of instrumentation include sensors used in agricultural machines and processes for measuring voltage, force, torque, pressure, displacement, velocity, acceleration, flow, temperature, and humidity. 
The course also covers analog and digital signal conditioning and processing, feedback control concepts, and computer interfaces. I taught the lab sessions every spring from 2020 to 2023.
